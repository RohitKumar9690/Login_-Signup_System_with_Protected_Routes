A secure and scalable user authentication system built with **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, **Tailwind CSS** for the frontend, and **Node.js** with **Express** for the backend. This project includes login and signup pages, user authorization, and protected routes to ensure secure access control for authenticated users only.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React-DOM**: Provides DOM-specific methods that allow React to interact with the web browser.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for creating a responsive and modern user interface.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for building the server-side application.
- **Express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing user data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB and Node.js, used to model user data and interact with the database.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For securely transmitting information between the frontend and backend.
- **bcryptjs**: For hashing and securing user passwords.
- **Cookie-parser**: Middleware for parsing cookies.
- **CORS**: To handle cross-origin resource sharing issues.
